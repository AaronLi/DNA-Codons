## Requirements
- Python 3  
- Curses  
    -  if you're not on Windows you should be able to stop reading
  
There are 3 options to use to install curses  
if it doesn't work the first time, try running them as admin
1. `firstrun.bat` easiest
2. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` slightly more difficult
3. `pip3 install windows-curses` also pretty easy until I add more requirements
